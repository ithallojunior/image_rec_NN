# Raccoon recognizer
Created by Ithallo J. A. Guimar√£es

# What is it?
It is an example of an MLP used to recognize raccoons. 
The *MarkDown* folder includes the version to be visualized 
in GitHub.

It also includes the images of the input layer "filters" of the MLP in the 
*mlp\_images* folder. It is mesmerizing to see, check it out.

# How to use it?
Just run the notebook, it is all set. 

If you have a file of a previously 
run  MLP (a *raccoon.ann* file), just change  "run" to "load" in the
**Training/Loading model** section of the notebook, otherwise, keep it in "run" and save it after running by writing "save" at the  **Saving to file for later use** section.



#### Have fun.
